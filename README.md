angular-dialog-service
======================

A complete AngularJS service with controllers and templates for generating application modals and dialogs for use with Angular-UI-Bootstrap and Twitter Bootstrap

Dependencies:

1.  Angular JS - www.angularjs.org (version 1.1.2 +)
2.  Angular UI Bootstrap - http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/modal (version 0.6.0 +)
3.  Twitter Bootstrap CSS (2 +)

Notes:

- I have personally used this module and service with Bootstrap 3 and have had no problems.  It should not rely on including the Bootstrap 3 JS.
